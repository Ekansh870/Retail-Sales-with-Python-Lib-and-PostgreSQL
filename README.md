# Retail-Sales-with-Python-Lib-and-PostgreSQL
This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be used together for data analysis and visualization. I worked on a Retail Sales dataset where I:  Built a PostgreSQL database to clean and analyze sales data with SQL. Integrated Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to extend the analysis and build clear visualizations.
